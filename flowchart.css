Flowchart representing Transmitter and Receiver Communication in UART


Transmitter converts parallel data to serial.
                ↓
Start bit added to signal the start of data transmission.
                ↓
Data bits sent sequentially over the TX line.
                ↓
Parity bit (optional) added for error checking.
                ↓
Stop bit added to mark the end of the frame.
                ↓
Receiver detects the start bit and synchronizes.
                ↓
Receiver reads the data bits and checks the parity (if present).
                ↓
Receiver removes start, parity, and stop bits.
                ↓
Receiver reconstructs the original parallel data.
